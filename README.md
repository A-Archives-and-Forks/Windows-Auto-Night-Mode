## Description
Microsoft provides a dark theme in Windows 10. You can switch manually between the implemented dark and white theme on the settings app. On the other side some programs or operating systems are allowing a automatic switch at a specific time. While it is bright outside, you have a bright OS. At afternoon it starts to get darker, so your operating system also switches to a darker look to take care of your eyes.

I wanted to have this kind of solution in Windows, so I wrote this little program.

With enabling the automatic theme switcher in the app, it creates a task in the task scheduler of Windows. This task will start the app with the right arguments. No background task, no interruption of a cmd-window, no footprint and no reliability issues. You can set your own preferred start-times in the user interface.

## Features
- Easy to use and clean User-Interface.
- Theme switch based on custom times.
- Theme switch based on the sunrise and sunset of your location.
- Easy theme switch with a Jump-List from the Startmenu or Taskbar.
- You can choose if only Apps should change their theme, or both apps and the system.
- Lightweight with 100% clean uninstall. No admin-rights needed.

## Note about the download
Google Chrome, Windows Smartscreen and some antivirus-programs may warn you from downloading this program. This is caused to the small user base. Sadly I can't change anything about that.
