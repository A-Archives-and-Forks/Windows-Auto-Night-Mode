Microsoft provides a dark theme in Windows 10. You can switch manually between the implemented dark and white theme on the Settings app. On the other hand some programs or operating systems are allowing a automatic switch at a specific time. While it is bright outside, you have a bright and clearly readable OS. At afternoon the sun starts to set and your operating system also switches to a darker look to take care of your eyes.

I wanted to have this kind of solution in Windows, so I wrote this little program.

With enabling the automatic theme switcher in the app it creates a task in the Task Scheduler of Windows. This task will start the app with the right arguments. No background task, no interruption of a CMD-window, no footprint and no reliability issues. You can set your own preferred start-times in the user interface.

### Annotation
Windows SmartScreen-Filter, your webbrowser or some antivirus software may warn you from downloading or starting this app. This is due to the missing signature license, which unfortunately I cannot afford. But from the numerous github stars you can see that many people use the program without problems.
