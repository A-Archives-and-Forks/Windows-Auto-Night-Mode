# Privacy for the Microsoft Store
We don't collect any data about our users.

The App checks at the start if a update is available. For that, the app connects to the internet and compares the version number of a XML-File with the current installed version number. We don't save any data in this process.

For using the location service, we use the Microsoft Bing API MapLocationFinder to get the users city-name. For this case, you should check the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
