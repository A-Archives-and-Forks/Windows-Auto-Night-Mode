# Auto Dark Mode Privacy Statement
We (the Auto Dark Mode Team) don't collect any data about our users. This app does not use telemetry, all settings are saved offline and
log files are only stored on the personal computer.

Some features of this App use third party services which may collect data:
By using Auto Dark Mode, you thus also agree to these service's privacy policies.

### Device Location using the Windows Geolocation API & Microsoft Bing API
On our side the collected data is only processed locally for sunrise/sunset calculation and does not leave the machine, nor is it used for analytics.

Microsoft Windows could collect some location data from your machine, for example we use the Microsoft Bing API "MapLocationFinder" to get your current
city name.

Because of this, the Microsoft data privacy policy applies:

### App Updater using the GitHub Server
Again on our side we don't collect any data from our users. Everything is processed on the machine and will never be transmitted via the internet.

To check for App Updates, we connect once to the GitHub-Server to retrieve an xml with information about the latest version. Additionally, the updater
can download the installer from the GitHub Server.

GitHub may collect some personal data while communicating with the GitHub Servers. Because of this, the GitHub data privacy policy applies:

* Picture folder (for choosing a Wallpaper, locally saved)
* File System (for choosing a Windows Theme, locally saved)
* Location service (for calculating sunrise)

### Changes to our Privacy Statement
Auto Dark Mode may change our Privacy Statement from time to time.
